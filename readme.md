# 🎰 **Lottery DApp — Spin the Chain, Win the Game** 🎰

Welcome to the **most unnecessarily awesome** decentralized lottery experience since Satoshi accidentally bought a raffle ticket with 10 BTC.  
We’ve got **smart contracts**, **a sleek frontend**, and enough developer swagger to make your terminal blush.

## 🚀 How to Run This Bad Boy Locally

> ⚠️ Warning: Running this locally might cause an uncontrollable urge to deploy to mainnet.

1️⃣ **Clone this intergalactic codebase**  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lottery-dapp.git
cd lottery-dapp
2️⃣ Summon the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install   # Or yarn/pnpm/bun, if you like living on the edge
npm run dev
3️⃣ Behold Your Creation
Open your browser and head over to:

http://localhost:3000
Prepare to be amazed.
If you’re not amazed… you probably forgot to turn your monitor on.

🧙 Smart Contract Setup (Optional but Legendary)
If you want to also mess with the smart contract like the blockchain wizard you are:

```bash
cd contract
anchor build
anchor deploy
💡 Pro tip: Use solana-test-validator to run it locally without accidentally selling your house on mainnet.

💡 Features
🎟 Buy Tickets — Because hope is a feature.

🏆 Pick Winners — Totally unbiased (except by the hash function).

💰 Claim Prizes — Instantly, without needing a banker in a suit.

🪄 On-chain Logic — Powered by Rust & Anchor for that artisanal blockchain flavor.

🛡 .gitignore Advice

node_modules/
.DS_Store
🐉 Final Words
You now have the power to run, modify, and potentially dominate the decentralized lottery scene.
Use this power wisely… or just spam yourself with tickets for testing purposes. We won’t judge.
